\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown are the major evaluation metrics used.

\subsubsection{Sharpe Ratio}

Sharpe ratio was first introduced by \cite{sharpe1966}. It measures the expected return gained per unit of risk taken for a zero investment strategy. According to the definition in \cite{sharpe1994}, assume \(R_{Pt}\) as a \(t\)-period return series, \(R_{ft}\) as the risk-free rate series over the same period. Then the Sharpe ratio \(S_h\) from \(t=1\) to \(t=T\):

\begin{align}
  S_h &\equiv \frac{\overline{D}}{\sigma_D} \\
  \text{where}~D &\equiv R_{Pt} - R_{ft} \\
  \overline{D} &\equiv \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T D_t \\
  \sigma_D &\equiv \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{t=1}^T (D_t-\overline{D})^2}{T-1}}
\end{align}
